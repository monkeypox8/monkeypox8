# Hi, I'm Kevin.
I'm a UX Developer at [Kajabi](https://kajabi.com): a [front of the front-end developer](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design-react-and-a-bridge-over-the-great-divide/). My goal is to help bridge the gap between design & development.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/teenwolfblitzer).
